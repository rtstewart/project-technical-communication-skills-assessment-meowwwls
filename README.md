# [WHAT IS REACTIVE PROGRAMMING?](https://github.com/moderndeveloper/project-technical-communication-skills-assessment-meowwwls/blob/master/reactiveprogramming.md)

**This exercise is for the Modern Developer program, career path 3 (Modern Front-end Developer)**

It's part of the first course *(Communicating Effectively for Success)*. The assignment was as follows:

>**Project Assignment 1: Assessing Your Technical Communication Skills**

>To graduate from Learn.Modern Developer, every student must be skillful at explaining technical concepts in a clear and comprehensible manner. Accordingly, we require all of our students to provide us with a sample of his or her writing.

>The writing assignment follows:

>Write a one- to two-page tutorial that explains what **reactive programming** is and how it works. You need neither prior knowledge nor expertise on the subject. For this first version of the assignment, use only the Wikipedia article (at the link below) to learn reactive programming. Don’t use any other sources; this is not a research project, and its purpose isn’t to test how much you know about reactive programming. The assignment asks only that you read the reactive programming article on Wikipedia and write your own clear and comprehensible tutorial on reactive programming, after learning everything you can from the Wikipedia article about reactive programming.

>Give your best effort and write the tutorial in such a clear and comprehensible manner that even a fourteen-year old, who just recently learned to code, can understand it. While we don’t require you to add any images or schematics to the tutorial, feel free to add an image or two to help aid comprehension of the material.

>We expect the writing to represent your best communication effort and your ability to explain. We’ll use your article to get a sense of your communication skills and see how well you improve over time; you’ll also use this assignment to track your own progress and improve your technical communication skills.
